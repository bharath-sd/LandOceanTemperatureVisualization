# LandOceanTemperatureVisualization
Through the analysis of NASA's Land-Ocean Temperature Index data, this study investigates patterns in global temperatures across time. Using a smoothing approach to emphasize longer-term climatic changes, the objective is to illustrate the evolution of Earth's temperature across time, revealing patterns, shifts, and trends in global warming.

# Overview

Annual temperature anomalies (in degrees Celsius) for both land and ocean surfaces are provided by the dataset utilized in this study, which covers the years 1880â€“2023. Two columns comprise the data:
No Smoothing: The raw temperature anomaly data is shown in this column.
Lowess(5): Using a locally weighted scatterplot smoothing method, this column presents a smoothed version of the temperature data.

# Dataset Details
The following variables are included in the dataset:

Year: The temperature reading's year.
No_Smoothing: That year's temperature anomaly without any smoothing.
The temperature anomaly following the application of the Lowess smoothing method is shown in Lowess (5).

# Visualization
1. Anomaly in Temperature (No Smoothing)
The raw temperature anomaly data over time is displayed in this figure. It draws attention to the short-term temperature variations, including the early 20th-century cold and the more recent warming episodes. With abrupt leaps and decreases that might not accurately reflect the larger patterns in the climate, this graphic illustrates the erratic nature of temperature variations.

2. The 10-year rolling average
By determining the average temperature anomaly over a 10-year period, the rolling average graphic smoothes the data. This provides a better sense of the general warming trend that has developed over the past century by highlighting the long-term patterns and cycles in the global temperature data. This graphic shows a clear rising trend, especially in recent decades, indicating the continued problem of global warming.

# Insights
Cooling in the Early 20th Century: Natural climatic variability and other variables may be responsible for the cooling observed in the first few decades of the data.
Post-World War II Warming: Temperature anomalies start to rise after the 1940s, with especially steep rises in the latter half of the 20th century.
Exponential Growth in Recent Years: A glaring indication of global warming, the most notable rise in temperature anomalies has occurred in the recent several decades, reaching a peak in 2016 and 2023.
10-Year Rolling Average: By mitigating short-term oscillations and emphasizing the steady warming of the Earth's surface, the rolling average validates the general rising trend.
